      <p>HTML5 is a W3C specification that defines the fifth major revision of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). One of the major changes in HTML5 is in respect to how HTML addresses Web applications. Other new features in HTML5 include specific functions for embedding graphics, audio, video, and interactive documents. New elements also allow you to define sections of your Web page using new tags such as <ul><li>< article > which defines an article</li>
      <li>< nav > which defines navigation links</li>
      <li>< source > which defines media resources, and many others.</li>
      <li> For example, the navigation section of your page would be enclosed in the < nav ></li></ul> tags.<br>

      <br>HTML5 may also be referred to as Web Applications 1.0. Some HTML codes can be found below.<br>
  <code><br><li>
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
</code>
  <li><code>
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
</code>

    <section class="main-section" id="Semantics">
      <header><b>Semantics</b></header>
        <p>One of the best (and, in my opinion, easiest) ways to get started with HTML5 is by using its new semantic elements for describing the structure of page content.
Before HTML5, developers commonly use IDs and/or class names with these tags. This conveys more meaning to the developers, but unfortunately, it doesn’t help browsers derive the purpose of that markup. In HTML5, there are new semantically rich elements that can convey the purpose of the element to both developers and browsers. </p>
      <ul><p>Here are some examples of the new semantic elements in HTML5:

<li>is used for content that can be grouped thematically. A can have a , as well as a . The point is that all content contained by is related.</li>
<li>typically contains the headline or grouping of headlines for a page and/or s, although it can also contain other supplemental information like logos and navigational aids. Notice that I said “page and/or s.” That means you could have multiple s on a page.</li>
<li>is used for content about a page and/or s, such as who wrote it, links to related information and copyrights. And, like , you could have multiple s on a page.</li>
<li>is used to contain major navigation links for a page. While it isn’t a requirement, will often be contained by , which, by definition, contains navigational information.</li>
<li>is used for content that is self-contained and could be consumed independent of the page as a whole, such as a blog entry. is similar to in that both contain related content. The best rule of thumb for deciding which element is appropriate for your content is to consider whether the content could be syndicated. If you could provide an Atom or RSS feed for the content, is most likely the way to go.</li>
<li>indicates the portion of a page that is tangentially related to the content around it, but also separate from that content, such as a sidebar or pull-quotes. A good method for deciding whether is appropriate is to determine if your content is essential to understanding the main content of the page. If you can remove it without affecting understanding, then is the element to use.</li></ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="Migration">
      <header><b>Migration</b></header>
        <p>Content Migration is the process of moving information stored on a Web content management system (CMS), Digital asset management (DAM), Document management system (DMS), or flat HTML based system to a new system. Flat HTML content can entail HTML files, Active Server Pages (ASP), JavaServer Pages (JSP), PHP, or content stored in some type of HTML/JavaScript based system and can be either static or dynamic content.</p>
